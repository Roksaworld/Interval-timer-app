**Task 1: create an interval timer**

Make a form with two fields and a button:
- time: number, in seconds
- label: text

When the button is clicked, the interval should be added to a list below the form, and I should be able to add another interval.

Add the interval times in descending order, i.e.:

- 1min Interval 1
- 3min Interval 2
- 1min Interval 3
- And so on...

When I have at least one interval on the list, a button should appear that will allow me to start my routine.

When I press start, display a timer screen.
The timer should have the remaining interval time minutes and seconds and label, and it should immediately count the time down.
When it reaches the end of the time, display the next interval on the list.

When all the intervals are complete, go back to the interval creation screen.

**Task 2: cancel**

Add a cancel button to the timer view. When I click it, take me back to the interval creation screen.

**Task 3: remove interval**

Add a button to each interval on the interval creation screen, that will allow me to remove a single interval.

**Task 4: alert when interval timers end**

When I'm on the timer screen and my timer reaches zero, my device should vibrate (if possible) and make a noise, to let me know
that I should switch activities.

**Task 5: store my routine**

Add a button to save my routine. When I press this button, give me a way of naming this routine.

Add a new page where I can see all of my routines, and can choose to start or edit them.

**Task 6: reordering intervals**

Give me the ability to easily reorder my interval timers, in case I put them in the wrong order or want to add a new one in the middle.

**Task 7: setting seconds or minutes**

Add the ability for me to enter an interval time in either minutes or seconds. 

**Task 8: pause**

Add a pause button to the timer view. When I press it, my timer should pause and change colour to make it clear that it has been paused. Add a button to allow me to resume when I'm ready.

**Task 9: edit interval**

Add a way for me to edit an individual interval I have already added to my routine, instead of having to remove it and add a new one.
